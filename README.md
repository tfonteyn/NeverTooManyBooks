## Thanks

In August 2018, this project was forked from:
Book Catalogue 5.2.2 @2016 Philip Warner & Evan Leybourn.
Without their original creation, this project would not exist in its
current form. It was however largely rewritten/refactored and any
comments on this fork should be directed at myself and not
at the original creators.

## History

### 4.6.6

FIXES

-fix #21 regression bug in UI in export

### 4.6.5

NEW:

- "page count" can now be shown on the booklist book level
- restructured access to individual website configuration settings.
  Instead of the more or less obscure "More..." preference menu,
  they are now accessible straight from the main "Websites" ordering screen.
- Clarified the limitations of "Search by title/author".

FIXES:

- fix #19 Publisher and PubDate are now fully independent to show/hide
  instead of partially linked as before.

---

### 4.6.0

NEW:

- Cover operations can now be undone (via the cover context menu).
  This can be disabled in preferences if you are low on storage space.

---

### 4.5.1

FIXES:

- UI bug in export

---

### 4.5.0

NEW:

- Amazon parsing has been brought up-to-date + amazon.es has been added to the tests.

- Deleted books will now be 'remembered'. This will allow importing a backup on a second device
  to automatically synchronize/mirror these deletions.

- improved displaying full-text-search results.

- added support for importing the "books.json" file from a backup-archive directly.

- add preference setting for a single barcode scan to automatically restart the scanner.
  There are now 3 ways to add books by scanning their barcodes:
  - single: "scan/edit"
  - continuous: "scan/edit/repeat"
  - batch: "scan/scan/.../edit/edit/..."

- resolving author names for Bedetheque itself is now also a user preference setting.

FIXES:

- fixed obscure bug the list would not rebuild after editing multiple books.

---

### 4.4.2

- fix #17 : Devices like the Pixel 6a which have a `height:expanded/width:compact` screen size
  should now display the filter and style-picker dialogs correctly.

---

### 4.4.1

- fix GoogleBooks engine compression support.
- fix setting a books read-status from from the book-list row menus.

---

### 4.4.0

NEW:

- performance improvement: automatic support for compression when fetching data from the web.

- improved compatibility with web sites.

- New field to hold the original-title of a translated book. None of the current information
  sources provide this data automatically; manual entry required. Displayed by default,
  but can be hidden via Settings/Field-Visibility.

- When editing a book, the language, format and colour drop-down fields will now show a
  set of defaults in addition to the users previously used values.

- Amazon captcha blocking now reported to the user + Amazon disabled when needed.
  It can still be re-enabled by the user to try again.

FIXES:

    any non-standard camera apps to be used automatically however.
  - The option to crop the image immediately after using the camera will now work as expected.

- date-added + date-last-updated are now displayed in the local timezone (previously shown in UTC).

- fixed an obscure bug in editing the styles where editing an existing style could result
  in creating a duplicate.

- Bedetheque author resolution was broken on Android 10 or lower.

- Bol.COM more reliable cover image download.

REMOVED:

- The crop option "whole picture" was removed and this behaviour is now always on.

---

### 4.3.5

- fix #12; the cover browser is now fullscreen on medium screens.

---

### 4.3.4

- fix #10 : when searching by Author/Title a search was quitting at the first "not-found".
  The search will now proceed to the next site.

---

### 4.3.3

NEW:

- The real-author name (pseudonym usage) can now be globally hidden (Settings/Field-visibility)
  and when enabled, is shown in some more places.
- The date-added + date-last-update fields for a book are now shown by default,
  but can be hidden (Settings/Field-visibility).

- Apply workaround for google issue 181655428. This fixes #9.

- Added preference setting to show/hide the shopping menus for amazon/bol.com.
- Note that this app is NOT affiliated with any sites.

FIXES:

- filter/style dialogs now expand properly on smaller screens.

---

- fix: enable KBNL and BedeTheque globally making them actually available. When upgrading,
  you'll still need to manually enable them in Settings/Websites on the books and covers tabs.
- Updated amazon price parsing for better results.

---

### 4.1.1

- Added more defensive checks and extra logging to the parsers which should help with
  decimal separator conflicts.

- Group/sorting by date-acquired now uses date-added as fallback when the former is
  not explicitly set.
- Embedded list/detail mode no longer needs to refresh the whole list when a cover is changed.
- Dialog boxes have been restyled using full Material.io v3.

FIXES:

---

### 4.0.0

NEW:

- New search-engine for Bedetheque (BDGest) for French comics
- Updated and re-enabled search-engine for KB.NL for Dutch books.
- Author pseudonym support:
  - The user can manage/display pseudonyms.
  - Automatic resolving is available for comics with stripinfo/lastdodo which use Bedetheque,
    and of course Bedetheque itself. This means the majority of european non-english comics
    (and a fairly large amount of English) are supported.
- Easier access to context menu's on the book list (button and/or long-click configurable).
- Booklist groups for author and publisher provide grouping/sorting on 1st character of the name.

- Importing badly formatted list-price fields no longer skips the book, but just skips
  the price field.
- Fixed filter name mismatches.

REMOVED:

- All CSV and XML exports are removed. It was increasingly difficult to keep them updated.
  Use JSON instead. A simplified CSV export is planned in a future version.
- TAR import is removed. This allowed the removal of the Apache library for tar.
  Repack any tar archive as a zip and import the zip.
