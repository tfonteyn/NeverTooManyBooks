In August 2018, this project was forked from:
_Book Catalogue 5.2.2 @2016 Philip Warner & Evan Leybourn._
Without their original creation, this project would not exist in its current form.
It was however largely rewritten/refactored and any comments on this fork should be
directed at myself and not at the original creators.
