<!-- Frustration alert: the width is hardcoded because there just seems to be no way
     of getting the width adjust to the maximum width of the other items in the RecyclerView
     where this view is used.
     When using android:gravity="fill_horizontal",
     It always maximizes the width of the Dialog.
     Using 320dp works well for all screen from sw320dp to sw800.
