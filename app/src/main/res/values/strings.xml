     Some linguists, especially in British English, believe that "loan" should only
     be used as a noun, while the correct verb is only "lend."


    ENTITY:
    Define entities that can be used inside of other string (not possible with standard Android
    resources e.g. the entities file define APP_NAME; use it in another string with: &APP_NAME;
    cannot put these into an external file: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/68434088

    Each language string.xml file uses localized quotes as per
