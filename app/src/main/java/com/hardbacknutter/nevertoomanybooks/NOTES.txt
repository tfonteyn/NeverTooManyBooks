Draft notes for next version:

### 6.0.0

NEW:
- Upgraded OpenLibrary support to their new Search-API.
  This gets additional fields including back-cover images.
- Replaced the now defunct LibraryThing API for alternative-edition cover searches
  with a new OpenLibrary version.
- Support for CSV imports from Goodreads.
- The main screen has a new menu-option (button) to quickly flip between list and grid-layout.
- All dialogs are now shown as bottom-sheets.
  The user can configure/reverse this behaviour in the advanced-settings.
- Large Context (popup) menus in the book list are now shown as a bottom-sheet on phones.
  Small menus are kept as popups. On tablets, all menus are kept as popups.
  The user can configure/reverse this behaviour in the advanced-settings.

FIXES:
- fix the issue with duplicate "(Year not set)" headers when sorting according to read-status.
- the multi-redirect issue with OpenLibrary covers download has been fixed
  by implementing a manual-redirect routine.

REMOVED:
- LibraryThing alternative-edition search

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amazon... or "why are these sites not supported?"
 * Goodreads is owned by Amazon and has shut their API down.
 * LibraryThing is 40% owned by AbeBooks which is owned by Amazon and the API is shut down.
 * Amazon and the above are now using Captcha to blocks app access.

ENHANCE: ISSN (serials) lookups?

ENHANCE: add book by search: allow publisher + present list of finds instead of using first found.
==> SearchCoordinator.search when isbn not provided, will run a search until it finds an isbn,
    and then redo the search WITH the isbn
==> so this is why we only ever get ONE result back.

FIXME: check all cover logic where source and destination is allowed to be the same
 We should ALWAYS use a temporary file to write to, and only on success rename it to
 the actual destination file to prevent loss of original on failure.

FIXME: the dialog-fragment launcher api is increasingly adding overhead.
 It needs to be replaced by ViewModel sharing on Activity level.

TODO: bring some unity to our use of child-fragments (e.g. ReadStatus)
 and helper/handlers (e.g. CoverHandler) and similar constructs

ENHANCE: add rotating functions to the cropper activity. This would allow
 multi-rotate-undo by simply quiting the cropper.

ENHANCE Pseudonyms on ISFDB:
 While reading the book page, we could follow the author url,
 and from there check the header for "Used As Alternate Name By"
 Problem: if it's the real-author anyhow, then loading
 that url can become very slow if the author has many books.
 Alternative: lookup Author names individually.

Known issues:

The node-management, i.e. storing the tree-state of the nodes in the booklist
 is by design not foolproof. The nodes 'expanded' flag WILL get out of sync with
 the display from time to time. There are no plans to fix this for now as the foolproof solution
 would take far to much disk space.

Prices: when importing books with a price field containing a value which cannot be parsed,
 the price field is silently dropped. Details see BookDaoHelper#filterValues.
 Some code can already deal with string-values in the Book bundle, but it is very likely
 that IF such a string would end up in the database somehow, we'll
 get a crash when trying to display it using a MoneyFormatter (FieldFormatter)
 FIXME: Solution would be to allow Money to have string (instead/aside-of double) values.

Booklist style sorting by date-read or date-added etc...:
 samsung A520 with A8.0, month name not shown; we get the month number instead.
 Does not happen on other devices/emulators. Won't pursue/fix.
